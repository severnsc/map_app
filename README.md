This is a simple React App designed to generate maps for Realtors. It takes in an address and desired map shape and will return a map from the Google Static Maps API. You can then download the map for use. 

To use the Google Static Maps API you need to obtain an API key. This project is currently setup to use a config.js file in the src folder to store the API key on your local server and then to import that key into the App.js file.
